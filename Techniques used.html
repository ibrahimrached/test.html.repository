<h1>Techniques used For Cryptography</h1>
<body>

<p>In todayâ€™s age of computers cryptography is often associated with the process where an ordinary 
plain text is converted to cipher text which is the text made such that intended receiver of the text can only
 decode it and hence this process is known as encryption. The process of conversion of cipher text 
 to plain text this is known as decryption.</p>

<h2>Features Of Cryptography</h2>

</p> Confidentiality:Information can only be accessed by the person for whom it is intended and no other person except him can access it.<br/>
Integrity:Information cannot be modified in storage or transition between sender and intended receiver without any addition to information being detected.<br/>
Authentication:The identities of sender and receiver are confirmed. As well as destination/origin of information is confirmed.</P><br/>

<h3>Types Of Cryptography</h3>
In general there are three types Of cryptography:
Symmetric Key Cryptography:It is an encryption system where the sender and receiver
 of message use a single common key to encrypt and decrypt messages. Symmetric Key 
 Systems are faster and simpler but the problem is that sender and receiver have to
 somehow exchange key in a secure manner. The most popular symmetric key cryptography system is Data Encryption System(DES).<br/>
Hash Functions:There is no usage of any key in this algorithm. A hash value with fixed length is
 calculated as per the plain text which makes it impossible for contents of plain
 text to be recovered. Many operating systems use hash functions to encrypt passwords.<br/>
Asymmetric Key Cryptography:Under this system a pair of keys is used to encrypt and decrypt information.
 A public key is used for encryption and a private key is used for decryption.
 Public key and Private Key are different. Even if the public key is known by 
 everyone the intended receiver can only decode it because he alone knows the private key.<br/>
